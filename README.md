<h1>FitTrack Lite</h1>

<p>I built an exercise app using ExerciseDB API you are able to get a quick exercise with one click and track progress including BMI calculations I would like to further implement such things as muscle group selections and saving what you have completed for the day and adding it to the progress page, along with creating a user based system to track users activity.</p>
<ul>
<h3>Current Features</h3>
<li>The lets workout button grabs a random body weight exercise</li>
<li>Equipment list allows you to add to the pool of exercises depending on what you select is available to you</li>
<li>On the progress page you are able to enter your name height and weight along with notes on your exercise that will log the date and calculate your bmi</li>

<h3>Future Features</h3>
<li>calculate calories burned through tracking exercises user completes and user input of time or rep</li>
<li>use chartJS to show progressional change in BMI</li>
<li>User database system</li>
</ul>
